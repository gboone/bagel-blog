Sometimes I just want a decent bagel that costs under $3, a mid-afternoon gluten bomb to pick up my spirits. As a reader of this blog, I can only assume this resonates deeply with you. Thank you for that validation.

I have to admit that this is mostly a situation of circumstance. That is to say, I only feel this way when I'm aimlessly walking down the street and _just so happen_ to pass a bagel merchant.

I walked into La Bagel Delight and walked out with a bagel that is as hard to fuck up as it is to make it stellar: an everything bagel with plain schmear.

The skill of the baker and a bit of the laziness of the preparer/toaster/schmear-spreader were embedded in the bagel. My praise to the baker for the firm, well seasoned crust and the softer, relatively light mantel. The toasting along the slice was sloppy, however, and the schmear was barely chilled and quickly became runny. All of that is somewhat reasonable on a day approaching 90Â°F.

The size of the bagel's hole was the hardest for me to digest as it was slightly more than an indentation in the surface. Perhaps it is important to question the virtue of the hole. That is to say, why are bagels with holes tastier than those without?

A larger hole allows for more surface area to be exposed to the boiling water, yielding a higher amount of crust. The ratio of crust to mantel decreases quickly as the hole gets larger because we trade the fluffy insides for more crust and air.

Of course, there is a point where the hole is too large for the bagel and the structural integrity suffers. This is just as bad a situation as too little hole. While I'm still exploring the optimal ratio, I have lately been enjoying bagels where the hole's diameter is roughly equal to one third of the diameter of the entire bagel.

If I'm being honest, my afternoon delight was by no means a good bagel, let alone stellar, but I definitely don't regret devouring it. Sometimes a bagel is just a decent bagel, to be consumed and then quickly forgotten.

<!-- The origin of the hole is the stuff of bagel lore, and as I'm not a bagel historian (yet) I don't feel qualified to pass judgement on which version is correct. But I will share two of my favorite origin stories.

The first rationale is as practical as it is boring. It goes something like when the Jewish immigrants first started hocking their bagel-wares on the streets of the Lower East Side they would carry around long sticks with stacks of bagels threaded on them. _Snooze_

A more clever edition dates back to when the bagel-making Jews lived under the Czars of Russia. The Czar demanded a 10% tax on all bread produced, and that it must come from the middle of the loaf. I'm personally with the Russian monarchs on this one, the ends of bread are the worst part.

The Jews were clever, as they are wont to be, and instead of making longer loaves started producing round loaves of bread and stamping out a hole from the middle that comprised 10% of the mass of bread. -->
